== A complete email marketing platform with everything you need -

= Create Any Type of Email Newsletter Effortlessly =
To achieve your marketing goals, you require various email marketing strategies. weMail allows you to set up any type of email campaign and carry out all these actions directly from your WordPress dashboard, without leaving your website.


- **[Standard Campaign](https://getwemail.io/docs/wemail/campaigns/types-of-campaigns/#how-does-standard-campaign-work):** Send one bulk email to several subscribers at once with a standard campaign. Whenever you need to connect with your subscribers, use the Standard Campaign.

**How to design and send bulk emails (also called mass email):**
Creating beautiful email campaigns with weMail is super easy. You get two types of editors to craft your email content - (i) Drag and drop builder and (ii) Writing-focused simplified editor.
You can use any built-in template from the weMail template gallery to design your newsletters quickly. Or, select blank templates to design them in your own style.
After completing email body or content, give a relevant Subject Line, From Name & Address, and a Reply-to Address.
Send instantly or schedule your drafted email campaign for later.

- **[Email Automation / Drip Campaign](https://getwemail.io/email-automation/):** Leverage the power of email automation to streamline your marketing efforts and nurture leads effectively. Create personalized drip campaigns tailored to your audience's needs, ensuring timely and relevant communication. With automated email sequences, you can automate follow-ups, welcome new subscribers, and provide required content to the right person at the right time. In weMail’s automation feature, you get to -

- Select multiple starting points or triggers (based on which action the automation will trigger): when someone subscribes to a list, purchases a product, gets a tag, or reaches a milestone/anniversary, etc.
- Create personalized customer journeys with an intuitive workflow builder. Use delays, if/else conditions, or combine multiple rules to send the right message at the right time.
- Not only sending drip campaigns, you can also take specific actions according to your email marketing needs, such as - copying or moving subscribers to a list, adding or removing tags, unsubscribing, and more – all on autopilot.

- **[Email A/B Testing](https://getwemail.io/a-b-split-testing/):** weMail lets you test two variations of a single campaign to determine which works best. You can run the test on any of the three elements (one at a time) - Email Subject, From Name, or Email Content.
There are two methods for split-testing an email campaign:

 - (i) Send your A/B Test Campaign to an entire list. Variation A will go to 50% of your audience and variation B will go to the other 50%. Check in-detailed campaign reports to determine the better-performed variation.
 - (ii) Send your A/B Test to a small group first, and then the better-performing variation will go out to the rest of the subscribers. Let’s say, you set a test group of 20% of your audience. So, 10% will receive variation A, 10% will get variation B, and the rest 80% will get the winning variation.
